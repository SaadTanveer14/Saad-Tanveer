The system allows doctors to mark their attendance within a defined radius, ensuring they are physically present at the hospital. It also facilitates doctors in providing patient feedback, capturing photos, recording audio from patients, and submitting their own feedback about the treatment. PMS operates both online and offline, enabling doctors to work in areas with limited internet connectivity, syncing data once the connection is restored. The app also offers reporting tools to track doctor performance, attendance, and leave management.",
                businessProblem: "In order to ensure treatment transparency and compliance with company policies, hospitals need to verify that doctors are physically present and delivering free-of-cost treatment as required. Additionally, in some hospital areas with poor or no internet connectivity, it is difficult for doctors to maintain real-time records of their visits, attendance, and patient interactions. Managing and tracking doctor performance in terms of visits, attendance, and feedback without a centralized digital system further complicates the process.",
                bigIdea: "The aim of PMS is to provide a comprehensive platform that helps track doctor attendance across multiple hospitals, ensuring transparency in treatment by collecting patient feedback and doctor reports. The system includes offline functionality to allow uninterrupted data entry in remote hospital areas with limited connectivity. This enables doctors to efficiently manage their tasks, mark attendance, complete visit forms, and provide feedback, while the administration can track overall performance and generate detailed reports on doctor activities.",

It allows users to replicate physical file actions such as adding remarks, rejecting files, and writing notes using a stylus on devices like the iPad. The app’s core feature is a custom canvas that enables users to write directly on files as if working with physical documents, making it ideal for pen-enabled devices. Users can also add additional remarks, upload attachments, and write on them, providing a comprehensive solution for file management.",

There is a growing need to digitize this workflow for modern devices, especially those that support stylus input like the iPad. However, existing digital tools and packages fail to offer the precision and functionality needed to replicate this process effectively on a digital platform.",

With the use of a custom canvas, users can write directly on files, much like working with physical documents. The app also leverages machine learning to convert handwritten remarks into computer-readable text, streamlining the file management process and enhancing productivity.",
